# Getting Started


Categories 
- Furniture
- Electronics
- Home Appliances
- - Major Appliances, 
- - - Kitchen Appliances and 
- - - General Appliances.
- - Minor Appliances, 
- - Lawn & Garden.




For each category there are zero or more keywords associated with it. <br>
This is used by our search engine to go to the specific category. 

Example: 

Lawn & Garden has keywords "Lawn", "Garden", "GardeningTools". 

If a certain category is missing keywords, it needs to inherit it from the parent. <br>


Assume that there is a Root Category that is at the highest level with a default set of keywords.
